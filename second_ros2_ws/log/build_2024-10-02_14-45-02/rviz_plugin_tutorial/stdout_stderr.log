[33mCMake Warning (dev) in CMakeLists.txt:
  No project() command is present.  The top-level CMakeLists.txt file must
  contain a literal, direct call to the project() command.  Add a line of
  code such as

    project(ProjectName)

  near the top of the file, but after cmake_minimum_required().

  CMake is pretending there is a "project(Project)" command on the first
  line.
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.

  Policy CMP0057 is not set: Support new IN_LIST if() operator.  Run "cmake
  --help-policy CMP0057" for policy details.  Use the cmake_policy command to
  set the policy and suppress this warning.

  IN_LIST will be interpreted as an operator when the policy is set to NEW.
  Since the policy is not set the OLD behavior will be used.
